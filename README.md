# Hello! 👋

My name is Matt and I'm a full-stack web developer based in Boston. I’m passionate about creating user-friendly websites and applications that are both  visually appealing and functional.

My current stack is:

- 🍃 Mongo
- 🇪 Express.js
- ⚛️ React w/ Typescript
- 🟩 Node.js 

I’m always eager to learn new technologies and tools to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects attending tech meetups and conferences. In my free time, I'm usually hiking somewhere in the White Mountains.

I'm currently open to new opportunities.
