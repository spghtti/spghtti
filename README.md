# Hello!

My name is Matt and I'm a full-stack web developer based in Boston. I’m passionate about creating user-friendly websites and applications that are both visually appealing and functional.

My current stack is Mongo, Express.js, React, and Node.js. But I’m always eager to learn new technologies and tools to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects attending tech meetups and conferences. In my free time, I'm usually hiking somewhere in the White Mountains.
